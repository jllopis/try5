# package httpcontext

`go get github.com/nbio/httpcontext`

Flexible per-request contexts for vanilla Go http.Handlers. Inspired by, and largely mirrors the interface of [gorilla/context](https://github.com/gorilla/context). It stores the request context directly in the http.Request by mutating the request.Body, avoiding the use of a global mutex and per-request teardown.
